<a id="packaging"></a><h1>Packaging a new release<a href="#packaging" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" alt="" /></a></h1>
<p>This section of the documentation is meant to explain the <a href="#packaging_steps">steps</a> needed to perform by the maintainer of the Coppermine package each time a new package release is being made.</p>
<p>This page does <strong>not</strong> deal with the steps that end users need to make when a new package comes out.</p>

<div class="indent">
    <a id="packaging_target_audience"></a><h2>Target audience<a href="#packaging_target_audience" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" alt="" /></a></h2>
    <p>This part of the documentation is not meant for end users of Coppermine, but <strong>only</strong> for developers. There is absolutely no support for this section, it comes as-is. If you're not a member of the Coppermine dev team, then the contents of this page are not meant for you.</p>
    <a id="packaging_target_audience_end"></a>

    <a id="packaging_subversion"></a><h2>Subversion repository<a href="#packaging_subversion" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" alt="" /></a></h2>
    <p>In the first place you need to perform core actions on the <a href="dev_subversion.htm#subversion">subversion</a> repository level of Coppermine. For this purpose, you need to have write access to the subversion repository, which is something you can not make up. A dev team member with project admin status needs to have granted you write access to the subversion repository that is hosted at sourceforge.net. You need to have some experience in using your subversion client before trying to accomplish the actions described here.</p>

    <a id="packaging_steps"></a><h2>Steps<a href="#packaging_steps" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" alt="" /></a></h2>
    These steps need to be taken to package a new release.
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a id="packaging_steps_checkout"></a><h3>Check out<a href="#packaging_steps_checkout" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" alt="" /></a></h3>
            As with all subversion operations, you need to perform a checkout to make sure that your working copy of the subversion repository is up-to-date.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a id="packaging_steps_version_number"></a><h3>Edit the version number<a href="#packaging_steps_version_number" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" alt="" /></a></h3>
            To edit the version number of the Coppermine release, you will need to edit several files:
            <ul>
                <li>The actual version number is being stored in the file <span class="code">include/init.inc.php</span>, so you will need to edit that file with a plain text editor and find <input type="text" readonly="readonly" value="define('COPPERMINE_VERSION', '1.6.X');" size="38" maxlength="38" class="code smaller" />, where X corresponds to the current minor version count that needs to be counted up.</li>
                <li>The version number output of all pages of the documentation is being replaced using the JavaScript file behind each localization folder; that's why you need to loop through all language folders within the <span class="code">docs</span>-folder, edit <span class="code">script.js</span>, find the definition for the function <span class="code">cpgDocHeader</span> and inside that definition change the localization line that corresponds to <input type="text" readonly="readonly" value="$('#docheader').text('Coppermine Photo Gallery v1.6.X: Documentation and Manual');" size="82" maxlength="82" class="code smaller" />, where X stands for the minor version number.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a id="packaging_steps_loop_through_files"></a><h3>Replace version number in all files<a href="#packaging_steps_loop_through_files" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" alt="" /></a></h3>
            You need to loop through all text files (file extensions <span class="code">.php</span>, <span class="code">.css</span>, <span class="code">.js</span>, <span class="code">.txt</span>, <span class="code">.sql</span>, <span class="code">.htm</span>) and replace the version number in the header with the version number of the new release.<br />
            <div class="cpg_example">You will have to find <input type="text" readonly="readonly" value="Coppermine version: 1.6.X" size="25" maxlength="25" class="code smaller" /> and replace with <input type="text" readonly="readonly" value="Coppermine version: 1.6.Y" size="25" maxlength="25" class="code smaller" /></div>
            To accomplish this, you will need a tool that can batch-replace in files:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a id="packaging_steps_loop_through_files_linux"></a><h4>Linux<a href="#packaging_steps_loop_through_files_linux" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" alt="" /></a></h4>
                    On most posix-compliant operating systems (like Unix, Linux, BSD etc.) you should have all needed tools at hand already. Basically you loop through all files with a given extension, search for the string inside it and replace it. The command that can be run in a console could look like this:
                    <textarea class="code smaller" style="width:100%" rows="1">find /path/on/filesystem/level/to/your/working/copy/ -maxdepth 4 -name "*.php" -o -name "*.css" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.txt" -o -name "*.sql" -o -name "*.htm" | xargs sed -i 's/Coppermine version: 1.6.X/Coppermine version: 1.6.Y/g'</textarea>
                    If you want to turn this into a shell script, don't forget the shebang at the start of the file (usually something like <span class="code">#!/bin/sh</span>).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a id="packaging_steps_loop_through_files_windows"></a><h4>Windows<a href="#packaging_steps_loop_through_files_windows" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" alt="" /></a></h4>
                    On Windows-driven computers you will need an editor that is capable to replace in multiple files or a tool that is dedicated to the replacement of text in files like the freeware apps <a href="http://www.emurasoft.com/replall/" rel="external" class="external">Replace in files</a> by Emurasoft or the app <a href="http://www.markus-bader.de/MB-SearchAndReplace/index.php" rel="external" class="external">MB-Search&amp;Replace</a> by Markus Bader. Both apps are available in English as well as in German and both don't require an installation (the executable runs out of the box, even from a USB stick or similar).
                </li>
            </ul>
            After having looped through all files, check in your subversion client if you actually have changed all non-binary files inside the package - all files should be marked as "changed" in your subversion client. Those that are not marked as changed require manual editing - maybe the version number had been forgotten to be changed in the previous release or when the file was <a href="dev_files.htm">added to the subversion repository</a> in the first place.<br />
    Don't commit your changes yet though; there are some more edits that need to be performed.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a id="packaging_steps_bom"></a><h3>Remove Byte Order Marks<a href="#packaging_steps_bom" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" alt="" /></a></h3>
            As Coppermine is a community effort and there are many developers who have write access to the subversion repository it might happen that a Byte Order Mark (BOM) has crept into non-binary files. This happens without the developer being aware of it and shouldn't cause a lot of fuzz among the dev team, yet it can cause serious issues after the release, with the byte order mark shining through on some or all pages and especially with authentification issues, as the pre-mature start of the output (even if it's just the accidental output of the BOM) will interact with the browser's ability to receive the header and subsequently the cookie.<br />
            That's the reason why it's a good idea to scan the non-binary files (file extensions <span class="code">.php</span>, <span class="code">.css</span>, <span class="code">.js</span>, <span class="code">.txt</span>, <span class="code">.sql</span>, <span class="code">.htm</span>) once more for the existance of a BOM and get rid of it if present. On Windows-driven computers, the BOM usually manifests with "funny" charcters - usually <span class="code">&iuml;&raquo;&iquest;</span>, so you should loop through all text-only files for that string and get rid of that string by replacing it with "" (nothing), using exactly the same tool used for the version number replacement above.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a id="packaging_steps_write_announcement_thread"></a><h3>Prepare an announcement thread<a href="#packaging_steps_write_announcement_thread" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" alt="" /></a></h3>
            Prepare an announcement thread in advance (before you actually release) inside the dev-only sub-board of the Coppermine forum. This thread can be empty - you can fill it later, or have another dev team member fill it. You need to create it in advance in order to be able to refer to the thread from within the documentation that will ship with the release.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a id="packaging_steps_docs_upgrade"></a><h3>Edit the upgrade section of the docs<a href="#packaging_steps_docs_upgrade" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" alt="" /></a></h3>
            Edit the <a href="upgrading.htm">upgrade section of the docs</a> and (if you can) the other corresponding sections of the localizations of the docs. Find the table inside the section &quot;<a href="upgrading.htm?expand_all=1#upgrade_why_reasons">Reasons for package releases</a>&quot; there and add a table row at the top with the needed information. Take a look at the other table rows that correspond to previous release to get an idea what should go into that section. Refer to the changelog file in the root folder to figure out about the changes that went into the release that you're about to package. Don't forget to refer to the announcement thread that you have created in the previous step to make sure you can inform users about last minute changes accordingly.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a id="packaging_steps_changelog"></a><h3>Edit the changelog<a href="#packaging_steps_changelog" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" alt="" /></a></h3>
            Add at least one line to the changelog that explains the version number change that you're about to commit. Add a line as well that mentions the release date.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a id="packaging_steps_svn_commit"></a><h3>Commit your changes<a href="#packaging_steps_svn_commit" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" alt="" /></a></h3>
            Of course you need to commit all your changes to the subversion repository, using your subversion client.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a id="packaging_steps_versioncheck"></a><h3>Update the versioncheck data<a href="#packaging_steps_versioncheck" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" alt="" /></a></h3>
            This is the most complicated step. It needs to be taken <em>after</em> having committed all other files to make sure that their revision numbers and hashes no longer are altered.<br />
            Edit the file <span class="code">include/cpg16x.files.xml</span> inside your working copy of the subverion repository with a plain text file.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a id="packaging_steps_versioncheck_complete"></a><h4>Completeness<a href="#packaging_steps_versioncheck_complete" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" alt="" /></a></h4>
                    In this step you need to make sure that the  XML file is complete. Loop through the changelog to check if all files (language files etc.) that have been <a href="dev_files.htm">added to the subversion repository</a> since the previous release have been added to <span class="code">include/cpg16x.files.xml</span> file as well. If all developers have done as suggested, there should be nothing left to do for you in this aspect. Save your changes (if any).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a id="packaging_steps_versioncheck_update"></a><h4>Update revision numbers and hashes<a href="#packaging_steps_versioncheck_update" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" alt="" /></a></h4>
                    Coppermine is storing the checksums for each file to allow the user to check that a file hasn't been tampered with. In this step, the checksums (hashes) are being calculated.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Run the versioncheck utility in your browser with the parameter <span class="code">?output=create</span> as suggested in <a href="dev_versioncheck.htm#dev_versioncheck_hidden_features">Versioncheck &rarr; Hidden features</a> while being logged in as admin (the URL in your browser's address bar looking like this: <span class="code">http://yourtestbed.tld/your_coppermine_folder/versioncheck.php?output=create</span>. The versioncheck tool will then loop through all files specified in <span class="code">include/cpg16x.files.xml</span> and re-calculate the hashes and outputs them again in XML.</li>
                        <li>There should be a huge textarea field that contains everything you need - just select the entire field's content,</li>
                        <li>copy to clipboard,</li>
                        <li>go to your editor where you have <span class="code">include/cpg16x.files.xml</span> opened previously,</li>
                        <li>highlight everything in the editor window and delete the content there.</li>
                        <li>Paste the content of the clipboard into the empty editor window that corresponds to <span class="code">include/cpg16x.files.xml</span>.</li>
                        <li>Then remove whitespace (if any) after the closing <span class="code">&lt;/file_data&gt;</span>-tag</li>
                        <li>and finally save the changes in <span class="code">include/cpg16x.files.xml</span>.</li>
                        <li>Go back to your browser window and remove the parameter <span class="code">?output=create</span> from the address bar. Make sure <strong>not</strong> to connect to the online repository by ticking the corresponding checkbox to make sure that you're looking at the changed file. In all the three columns &quot;Version&quot;, &quot;Revision&quot; and &quot;Modified&quot; you should by now see green check icons that show everything is OK. There mustn't be any warnings in red. If this is the case, continue.</li>
                        <li>Commit your changes applied to <span class="code">include/cpg16x.files.xml</span> to the subversion repository.</li>
                    </ul>

            Create a tag using your svn application. The target directory name will be the abbreviation <span class="code">cpg</span> followed by the exact version number. So the target URL will be <span class="code">https://svn.code.sf.net/p/coppermine/code/tags/cpg1.6.X</span>, where X represents the minor version number that you're about to tag.

            By now it's time to create the actual package, so you may be tempted to just zip your local working copy of the subversion repository, but that would be a very bad idea, as both your individual config file as well as all your changes (e.g. test uploads etc.) would be residing in that copy. Additionally, a lot of garbage would reside in that copy, as subversion creates a lot of hidden files inside your local working copy.<br />
            That's why you need to perform an export from the subversion repository into a new, empty folder on your client and use that from now on. This will make sure that only the files that are meant to go into the package will actually go into your package.<br />
            How the export feature actually works depends on the subversion client you use. The list items below describe the process just for some example clients:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a id="packaging_steps_rapidsvn"></a><h4>RapidSVN<a href="#packaging_steps_rapidsvn" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" alt="" /></a></h4>
                    The subversion client <a href="http://rapidsvn.tigris.org/" rel="external" class="external">RapidSVN</a> is available for many platforms (Linux, Windows, Mac OS/X, Solaris, etc.) and in many languages (English, German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Ukrainian, Simplified Chinese, Japanese). The Coppermine dev team recommends it as graphical client on Linux-driven systems.
                    <ul>
                        <li>In the left frame that represents the folder view, highlight the folder that represents the root of cpg1.6.x</li>
                        <li>Click on the menu entry "Repository" - "Export..."</li>
                        <li>In the export dialog, make sure that as revision the "Use latest" checkbox is ticked and that the "Recursive" checkbox is ticked as well.</li>
                        <li>As Destination directory, you need to specify a folder name that <em>doesn't</em> already exist within a folder that <em>does</em> exist. This dialog is a little bit unusual, so here's a detailed example, assuming that you're on Linux and that your user name is <span class="code">johndoe</span>:
                            <ul>
                                <li>On the export dialog, click on the button with the three dots within the "Destination Directory" section that allows you to browse the folder structure</li>
                                <li>In the sub-dialog that open, browse to the Desktop folder within your user's home folder, i.e. to <span class="code">/home/johndoe/Desktop</span> and hit the "OK" button. This will close the sub-dialog and populate the input field "Destination Directory" in the export dialog with the absolute path you just selected.</li>
                                <li>Click into this input field to put your cursor into that field to the end (right after <span class="code">/home/johndoe/Desktop</span>) and type a slash, followed by the name of the sub-folder that you want to get created, e.g. <span class="code">cpg16x</span>. After you did that, the input field's content now should look similar to this: <span class="code">/home/johndoe/Desktop/cpg16x</span></li>
                                <li>After having verified that everything looks as expected, click on the "OK" button of the export dialog.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

            Create an archive according to the <a href="dev_plugins.htm#plugin_writing_naming_conventions">naming conventions</a>, using your favorite archiver (on Windows, 7-Zip is recommended). The naming convention for package releases is pretty straightforward: it's just the abbreviation <span class="code">cpg</span> followed by the exact version number. Subsequently, your archive should be named <span class="code">cpg1.6.X.zip</span>, where X represents the minor version number that you're about to package. Its'mandatory to come up with a  <span class="code">zip</span> archive, but you can come up with additional archives as well (e.g. <span class="code">.7z</span>, <span class="code">.tar.gz</span> or <span class="code">.tar.bz2</span>) to make things easier for users on alternative operating systems.

            The xml file that contains the information about the most recent stable release needs to be uploaded to the official web space, replacing the file http://coppermine-gallery.net/cpg16x.files.xml that clients will connect to when checking for upgrades with the one from the subversion repository (e.g. the file that corresponds to https://svn.code.sf.net/p/coppermine/code/trunk/cpg1.6.x/include/cpg16x.files.xml). If you don't have access to the project's official webspace by FTP, ask a fellow developer to perform this task for you.
