<h2 style="text-align:center;">GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<a href="#gpl" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">Version 3, 29 June 2007</p>

<p>Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;<a href="http://fsf.org/" rel="external" class="external">http://fsf.org/</a>&gt;</p>
<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>

<h3><a id="preamble"></a>Preamble<a href="#preamble" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h3>
<p>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.</p>
<p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
 to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast, 
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to 
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
 software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the 
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to 
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to 
your programs, too.</p>
<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not 
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you 
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for 
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you 
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new 
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p>
<p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you 
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
 certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or 
if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</p>
<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether 
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same 
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive 
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they 
know their rights.</p>
<p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: 
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License 
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</p>
<p>For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
 that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and 
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as 
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to 
authors of previous versions.</p>
<p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run 
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
 can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of 
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic 
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to 
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we 
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
 products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we 
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
 of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</p>
<p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. 
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of 
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to 
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could 
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that 
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</p>
<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.</p>

<h3><a id="terms"></a>TERMS AND CONDITIONS<a href="#terms" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h3>

<h4><a id="section0"></a>0. Definitions<a href="#section0" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h4>
<p>“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</p>
<p>“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.</p>
<p>“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this 
License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”.  “Licensees” and 
“recipients” may be individuals or organizations.</p>
<p>To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the 
work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making 
of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a “modified version” of 
the
earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.</p>
<p>A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.</p>
<p>To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without 
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for 
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a 
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying, 
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the 
public, and in some countries other activities as well.</p>
<p>To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other 
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
 a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</p>
<p>An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to
 the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible 
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells
 the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent 
that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under 
this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If the interface 
presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent
 item in the list meets this criterion.</p>

<h4><a id="section1"></a>1. Source Code.<a href="#section1" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h4>
<p>The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 making modifications to it.  “Object code” means any non-source form of
 a work.</p>
<p>A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official 
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of 
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is 
widely used among developers working in that language.</p>
<p>The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other 
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of 
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major 
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major
 Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an 
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A “Major
 Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel,
 window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on 
which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, 
or an object code interpreter used to run it.</p>
<p>The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all 
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable 
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to 
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's 
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free 
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but 
which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source 
includes interface definition files associated with source files for the
 work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked 
subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as 
by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms
 and other parts of the work.</p>
<p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can 
regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.</p>
<p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.</p>

<h4><a id="section2"></a>2. Basic Permissions<a href="#section2" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h4>
<p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of 
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated 
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited 
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a 
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its 
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your 
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</p>
<p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
 without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. 
 You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having 
them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with 
facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the 
terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not 
control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works for 
you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and 
control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your 
copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</p>
<p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
 conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes
 it unnecessary.</p>

<h4><a id="section3"></a>3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law<a href="#section3" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h4>
<p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological 
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11
 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar 
laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.</p>
<p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid 
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
 is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the
 covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or 
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's 
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of 
technological measures.</p>

<h4><a id="section4"></a>4. Conveying Verbatim Copies<a href="#section4" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h4>
<p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you 
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and 
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep
 intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive 
terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all 
notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy 
of this License along with the Program.</p>
<p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</p>

<h4><a id="section5"></a>5. Conveying Modified Source Versions<a href="#section5" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h4>
<p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to 
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms 
of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
	<li>The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.</li>
	<li>The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released 
under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This 
requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all 
notices”.</li>
	<li>You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
 anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore
 apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the 
whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are 
packaged.  This License gives no permission to license the work in any 
other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have 
separately received it.</li>
	<li>If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display 
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive 
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need
 not make them do so.</li>
</ol>

<p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent 
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and
 which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or 
on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an 
“aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used 
to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond 
what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work in an 
aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the
 aggregate.</p>

<h4><a id="section6"></a>6. Conveying Non-Source Forms<a href="#section6" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h4>
<p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of 
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable 
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these 
ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
	<li>Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product 
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the 
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used
 for software interchange.</li>
	<li>Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product 
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written 
offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer
 spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone 
who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding 
Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this 
License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software 
interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically
 performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the 
Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.</li>
	<li>Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the 
written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This alternative is 
allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received 
the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.</li>
	<li>Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place 
(gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the 
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no 
further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the 
Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to copy 
the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a
 different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports 
equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions 
next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.  
Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain 
obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to 
satisfy these requirements.</li>
	<li>Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided 
you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of
 the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under 
subsection 6d.</li>
</ol>
<p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
 from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included
 in conveying the object code work.</p>
<p>A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any 
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, 
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for 
incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a 
consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.
  For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally 
used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, 
regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which 
the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the
 product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the 
product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, 
unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the 
product.</p>
<p>“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, 
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
 and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product 
from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information 
must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified 
object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because 
modification has been made.</p>
<p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or 
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as 
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the 
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a 
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the 
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by 
the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply if 
neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified 
object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been 
installed in ROM).</p>
<p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
 requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or 
updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient,
 or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  
Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself 
materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or 
violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.</p>
<p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
 in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly 
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source
 code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, 
reading or copying.</p>

<h4><a id="section7"></a>7. Additional Terms<a href="#section7" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h4>
<p>“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this 
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. 
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall 
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent 
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions 
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately 
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this
 License without regard to the additional permissions.</p>
<p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option 
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of 
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal
 in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place additional 
permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you 
have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
 add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders 
of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
	<li>Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</li>
	<li>Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or 
author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices
 displayed by works containing it; or</li>
	<li>Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or 
requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in 
reasonable ways as different from the original version; or</li>
	<li>Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or</li>
	<li>Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or</li>
	<li>Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material
 by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with 
contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability
 that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors 
and authors.</li>
</ol>
<p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further 
restrictions” within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you 
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is 
governed by this License along with a term that is a further 
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains a
 further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this 
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of
 that license document, provided that the further restriction does not 
survive such relicensing or conveying.</p>
<p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you 
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional 
terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find 
the applicable terms.</p>
<p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the 
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above
 requirements apply either way.</p>

<h4><a id="section8"></a>8. Termination<a href="#section8" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h4>
<p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly 
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or 
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under 
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third 
paragraph of section 11).</p>
<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your 
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and 
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright 
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means 
prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p>
<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is 
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the 
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have 
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that 
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your
 receipt of the notice.</p>
<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the 
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under 
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently 
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same 
material under section 10.</p>

<h4><a id="section9"></a>9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies<a href="#section9" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h4>
<p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or 
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work 
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to 
receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However, nothing 
other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any
 covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept 
this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, 
you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</p>

<h4><a id="section10"></a>10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients<a href="#section10" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h4>
<p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically 
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and 
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible 
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p>
<p>An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an 
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an 
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered 
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction 
who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the 
work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the 
previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding 
Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor 
has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</p>
<p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the 
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may not
 impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights 
granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation 
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any
 patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale,
 or importing the Program or any portion of it.</p>

<h4><a id="section11"></a>11. Patents<a href="#section11" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h4>
<p>A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this 
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The 
work thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.</p>
<p>A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned
 or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter
 acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this 
License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do 
not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of 
further modification of the contributor version.  For purposes of this 
definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a
 manner consistent with the requirements of this License.</p>
<p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free 
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make,
 use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and 
propagate the contents of its contributor version.</p>
<p>In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express 
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent 
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to 
sue for patent infringement).  To “grant” such a patent license to a 
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a 
patent against the party.</p>
<p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, 
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to 
copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a 
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, 
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so 
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the 
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner 
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent 
license to downstream recipients.  “Knowingly relying” means you have 
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the 
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work 
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that 
country that you have reason to believe are valid.</p>
<p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or 
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a 
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties 
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or
 convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you
 grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work 
and works based on it.</p>
<p>A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within 
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned 
on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically 
granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you 
are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business
 of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third 
party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and 
under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would 
receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) 
in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies
 made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with 
specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless 
you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, 
prior to 28 March 2007.</p>
<p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting 
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise
 be available to you under applicable patent law.</p>

<h4><a id="section12"></a>12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom<a href="#section12" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h4>
<p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement 
or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do 
not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot 
convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations 
under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a 
consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to 
terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from 
those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy 
both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from 
conveying the Program.</p>

<h4><a id="section13"></a>13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License<a href="#section13" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h4>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have 
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed 
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single 
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this 
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, 
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, 
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the 
combination as such.</p>

<h4><a id="section14"></a>14. Revised Versions of this License<a href="#section14" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h4>
<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions 
of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions 
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in 
detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the 
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General 
Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option
 of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version 
or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If 
the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public 
License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software 
Foundation.</p>
<p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future 
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's 
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you 
to choose that version for the Program.</p>
<p>Later license versions may give you additional or different 
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any 
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a 
later version.</p>

<h4><a id="section15"></a>15. Disclaimer of Warranty<a href="#section15" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h4>
<p style="text-transform:uppercase;">There is no warranty for the 
program, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Except when 
otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and/or other parties 
provide the program “as is” without warranty of any kind, either 
expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied 
warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The 
entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with 
you. Should the program prove defective, you assume the cost of all 
necessary servicing, repair or correction.</p>

<h4><a id="section16"></a>16. Limitation of Liability<a href="#section16" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h4>
<p style="text-transform:uppercase;">In no event unless required by 
applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder, or any
 other party who modifies and/or conveys the program as permitted above,
 be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, 
incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability 
to use the program (including but not limited to loss of data or data 
being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or
 a failure of the program to operate with any other programs), even if 
such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such 
damages.</p>

<h4><a id="section17"></a>17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16<a href="#section17" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h4>
<p>If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided 
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, 
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an
 absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, 
unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the 
Program in return for a fee.</p>

<a id="copyrights_previous_versions"></a><h2>Previous versions<a href="#copyrights_previous_versions" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h2>
<p>Versions prior to cpg1.4.13 used to be released under GNU GPL version
 2. As the Free Software Foundation has released version 3 of the 
license, we updated the license reference for cpg1.4.13 and all 
subsequent releases of the cpg1.4.x, cpg1.5.x and cpg1.6.x accordingly.<br>
Subsequently, all versions of Coppermine from that time on (2006-10-29) will be released under GNU GPL version 3.</p>

<a id="copyright_additional"></a><h2>Additional terms (license add-ons)<a href="#copyright_additional" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h2>
<p>The GNU GPL does not allow further restrictions of permissions except the additional terms that <em>can</em> be added according to section 7 of the GNU GPL v3.</p>
<p>Coppermine <strong>is</strong> being released under the GNU GPL with the following, GPL-compliant additional terms:</p>

<div class="indent">

    <a id="copyright_additional_preservation"></a><h3>Preservation of author attributions<a href="#copyright_additional_preservation" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h3>
    <p class="cpg_message_info">According to GNU GPL v3, <a href="?expand_all=1#section7">section 7</a> b)</p>
    <p>In versions prior to cpg1.5.x, the Coppermine group (<abbr title="also known as">aka</abbr>
 Coppermine Dev Team) required the preservation of the "Powered by 
Coppermine" footer in a legible, unobscured manner in the output of all 
pages generated by Coppermine-driven galleries.<br>This policy was 
changed with the release of cpg1.5.x. Starting with cpg1.5.x, it was no 
longer part of the license to keep this footer intact in legal terms. 
The reason for this change of policy lies in the nature of the internet 
and the fact that the Coppermine group doesn't have the funds nor 
inclination to enforce the preservation of the footer before legal 
courts. It has originally been made a requirement by the initial author 
of the first version of Coppermine. However, we <strong>ask</strong> you
 (the end user) to respect the wish of the original creator of 
Coppermine and keep the footer intact. Additionally, we have a strict 
policy on the Coppermine support forum that galleries with the footer 
tag removed will not receive support, as it is our choice to whom we 
give support. We're convinced that you should give credit where credit 
is due. We ask you to think twice before removing the tag, as it is 
meant to spread the word about Coppermine and give others who like your 
Coppermine-driven gallery the opportunity to get one of their own.</p>
    <p>The Coppermine Dev Team welcomes that version 3 of the GNU GPL 
clarifies the legal aspect of author attributions and demands of any 
third parties to respect the <em>full</em> license, including the additional terms covered in this section of the documentation. This means that it <strong>is</strong>
 allowed to edit or remove the "Powered by Coppermine" tag from the 
output generated by Coppermine-driven galleries, however you are not 
allowed to remove the author attribution from the source code of 
Coppermine.</p>
    <p>It <strong>is</strong> acceptable (fair use) to edit the "Powered by Coppermine" footer in a manner that explains who holds the copyrights of <em>content</em> displayed on a gallery.</p>
    <div class="cpg_example">
    <a href="http://coppermine-gallery.net/" rel="external" class="external">Powered by Coppermine</a>, all photos © by <a href="http://example.com/">John Doe</a>.
    </div>
    <p>For details on how to edit or remove the "Powered by Coppermine"-footer, please review the section <a href="theme_copyright.htm">Themes: Copyright-disclaimer in footer</a>.</p>

    <a id="copyright_additional_marking"></a><h3>Marking of modified versions<a href="#copyright_additional_marking" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h3>
    <p class="cpg_message_info">According to GNU GPL v3, <a href="?expand_all=1#section7">section 7</a> c)</p>
    <p>The Coppermine Dev Team requires as additional term of the 
license Coppermine comes with that modified versions of Coppermine 
conveyed to others should be marked in a reasonable way. Modified 
versions mustn't be conveyed to others under the same name as the 
original Coppermine release. Package name, source code and the output 
generated by the modified version should make it obvious for potential 
users that the modified version and the original Coppermine version that
 the modified version is based upon differ.</p>

    <div class="cpg_example">If you create a port of Coppermine with the added feature to brew coffee, name it in a way as suggested below:
    <ul>
      <li>Coppermine - coffee edition</li>
      <li>Coppermine with Coffee-Support</li>
      <li>Coppermine ported for CoffeeMaker v1.8</li>
    </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="indent">

        <a id="copyright_additional_marking_explanation"></a><h4>Explanation<a href="#copyright_additional_marking_explanation" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h4>
        <p>If you download Coppermine and modify it for use on your 
webspace, you don't have to rename it - the above mentioned additional 
term does not apply to you. It only applies if you make your modified 
version available to others for download or other means of distribution.<br>
        We think that this helps both the Coppermine project as well as 
the author of the modified version: people who are using the modified 
version can find out easily where they can turn to for help. The author 
of the modification gets the credit he deserves. The Coppermine Dev Team
 can make sure that issues caused by third-party modifications have less
 impact on the reputation of the original package. This applies 
especially to so-called "ports", where the Coppermine core code is 
edited to work embedded into third-party content management systems or 
frameworks.</p>

        <a id="copyright_additional_marking_suggestion"></a><h4>Suggestion<a href="#copyright_additional_marking_suggestion" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h4>
        <p>Port authors are encouraged to bundle a changelog or some 
other record with their port that clarifies what has been changed in 
"their" version of Coppermine, compared to the original from 
coppermine-gallery.net. Preferably, there should be notes that explain 
what version of coppermine the port is based on and what exactly has 
changed, e.g. what makes the port different. This is only a suggestion 
though and not a license add-on.</p>

<a id="copyright_freedom"></a><h2>Freedom<a href="#copyright_freedom" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h2>
<p>As you can see, the license that Coppermine comes with gives you a 
lot of freedom: it allows you to use it for free, to give it to others, 
to improve it or to make something different out of it. You can mash it 
up with other applications or use it standalone. This is what makes free
 and open source software so attractive for developers: not only is it 
available free of charge (although you can even try to sell it if you 
should find someone who's ready to pay for something that is available 
elsewhere for free), but it enables you to use your creativity and 
imagination to build something new out of it. We (the Coppermine dev 
team members) would love to see what you were able to accomplish with 
"our" application, so if you have a surprising, entertaining gallery, if
 you feature good, fresh content or amazing new features, please let us 
know about it on the corresponding thread on the official Coppermine 
site.</p>
<p>We respect freedom so much that we even can live with others abusing 
the freedom given to them: there are two aspects to the GNU GPL (or any 
other <abbr title="Free and Open Source Software">FOSS</abbr> license): 
the text of the actual license and the spirit behind it (i.e. the reason
 why developers initially choose the GNU GPL for a fresh project). In 
legal terms, it's allowed to change the Coppermine package 
insignificantly (i.e. by changing one single line of code of the many 
thousand lines that Coppermine consists of) and then re-bundling it 
under another name that you have come up with or by adding credits to 
the person who performed the minor edit. That is being covered by the 
license as well, but in the opinion of the Coppermine Dev team members 
it is not what the license is about - it simply isn't fair use in our 
opinion. You might think that nobody would act so bluntly, but in fact 
that's what has happened already: a third party has performed a minor 
edit and then they changed the "Powered by Coppermine" tag at the bottom
 of the output of the gallery to link to their site instead of the 
official Coppermine Gallery homepage. On the homepage of the "spin-off" 
(where the site owner offers paid Coppermine support and webhosting with
 pre-installed coppermine galleries) the site owner constantly publishes
 flames against the original coppermine developers and the genuine 
package, trying to create the impression that there was a distinctive 
difference between "his" modified Coppermine package and the original 
from coppermine-gallery.net. We leave it up to the judgement of the 
Coppermine Community (i.e. our users) if they think that this is fair 
use.</p>
