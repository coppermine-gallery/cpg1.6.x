<a id="dev_config_add"></a><h1>Adding config options<a href="#dev_config_add" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" alt="" /></a></h1>
<p>This page is supposed to explain how to add (or edit) a config option.</p>
<a id="dev_config_add_target_audience"></a><h2>Target audience<a href="#dev_config_add_target_audience" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" alt="" /></a></h2>
<p>This part of the documentation is not meant for end users of Coppermine, but only for developers. There is no support for this section, it comes as-is.</p>

<a id="dev_config_history"></a><h2>History<a href="#dev_config_history" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" alt="" /></a></h2>
<p>In versions prior to cpg1.5.x, the language file contained part of the logic how the config page looked and worked (section separation, help-icon links, input field type). This caused confusion for translators and kept the language fallback function from fully working as expected.</p>
<p>Additionally, every new config option that displayed a link to another page or that was supposed to offer different text for radio buttons required devs to come up with a separate function that made the code of the config file become more and more bloated.</p>
<p>In an effort to clean up the config screen and allow future enhancements, the config page (admin.php) has been re-coded.</p>

<a id="dev_config_new_features"></a><h2>New features<a href="#dev_config_new_features" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" alt="" /></a></h2>
<p>The end user will see little changes on the new config screen - most changes happened &quot;under the hood&quot;. Most obvious change is the regex check that is performed when the form is being submit: invalid entries are being caught and subsequently won't be written to the database. The end user will see a visualization what config setting needs review.</p>

<a id="dev_config_step_by_step"></a><h2>Step by Step<a href="#dev_config_step_by_step" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" alt="" /></a></h2>
<p>Apply the following steps when adding a config option during the development stage:</p>


<a id="dev_config_step_basiq_sql"></a><h3>Basic.sql<a href="#dev_config_step_basiq_sql" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" alt="" /></a></h3>
<p>Add the needed sql queries to sql/basic.sql for fresh installs. The config entries should exist in alphabetical order.</p>
<div class="cpg_example">
If your new config option is named &quot;enable_coffee_making&quot; entry, find <span class="code">INSERT INTO CPG_config VALUES ('enable_plugins', '1');</span> and add your new line before it.
</div>

<a id="dev_config_step_update_sql"></a><h3>Update.sql<a href="#dev_config_step_update_sql" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" alt="" /></a></h3>
<p>To make sure your new config option is not only taken into account for fresh installs, but for updates as well, you will have to add your new query line that you already added to basic.sql to update.sql as well. The only difference is that you don't sort the entries as in basic.sql, but add them at the very bottom of update.sql</p>

<a id="dev_config_step_array"></a><h3>Admin.inc.php<a href="#dev_config_step_array" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" alt="" /></a></h3>
<p>As suggested above, the logic of the config entry has been moved from the language file to a separate, language-independent include file. Edit include/admin.inc.php and add a new line to the array definition there are suggested below.</p>
<div class="cpg_example">
If you want your new config option to be displayed beneath the &quot;Enable plugins&quot; entry, find <pre class="code">    'enable_plugins' => array(
      'type' => 'radio',
      'help_link' => 'f=configuration.htm&amp;as=admin_general_enable-plugins&amp;ae=admin_general_enable-plugins_end',
      'options' => array($lang_common['no'],
                         $lang_common['yes'].'&nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="pluginmgr.php">'.$lang_admin_php['manage_plugins'].'</a>)'
                         )
    ),</pre> and add your new array definition below it (into a new line).
</div>

<a id="dev_config_step_language_file"></a><h3>Language file<a href="#dev_config_step_language_file" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" alt="" /></a></h3>
<p>During the development stage, only lang/english.php needs to be kept up to date. Edit the needed language strings to the array $lang_admin_php in the language file.</p>
<p>Remember to tag your newly-added string with the comment that shows your line is new.</p>

<a id="dev_config_step_documentation"></a><h3>Documentation<a href="#dev_config_step_documentation" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" alt="" /></a></h3>
<p>The goal is to have a help icon available for all config settings. Subsequently, you should at least come up with a short section for the <a href="configuration.htm">config page</a> of the documentation that explains what the config setting you introduce does, what the default values are etc.<br />Remember to add the anchors for the help icon to work properly.</p>
<p>This step is not mandatory in technical terms, but it will help both developers as well as end users to understand what your config option actually does. If your config options needs to be explained in more detail, consider creating a separate page within the documentation that covers details about the feature you added. Refer to the page <a href="dev_documentation.htm#dev_documentation_edit">Editing the documentation</a> for details.</p>

<a id="dev_config_todo"></a><h2>To Do<a href="#dev_config_todo" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" alt="" /></a></h2>
<p>There are some additional features for the config page that should be implemented in the near future</p>
<ul>
  <li>Change the data taken from include/admin.inc.php from an array definition to XML. Should be easy to implement once we have XML support</li>
  <li>Add a config section for plugins: allow plugin authors to use the plugin page to control their plugin as well. End users will then have <strong>one</strong> config screen where they can configure their gallery, as a separation between a core config and a plugin config feels alien for most non-coders</li>
  <li>Improve the regex checks</li>
</ul>
