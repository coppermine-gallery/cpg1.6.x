<a id="theme_php"></a><h1>Editing theme.php<a href="#theme_php" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" alt="" /></a></h1>
<p>Every theme comes with the file theme.php. However, for most themes, the file is nearly empty. The reason for that is that only things that <strong>differ</strong> from Coppermine's default behaviour needs to be described in theme.php. Things that are suppossed to work "the usual Coppermine way" are being defined in the core code - your custom theme's theme.php contains the variables and function definitions that override the identical items in the default core.</p>
<p>The &quot;<strong>theme.php</strong>&quot; file contains all the HTML templates used by the script. You can edit them, as well. When making modifications to these templates, be careful that you do not alter the lines that start with <span class="code">&lt;!-- BEGIN xxx --&gt;</span> and <span class="code">&lt;!-- END xxx --&gt;</span>. These lines are often used to identify the start and end of specific code blocks that the script will use to display your gallery.</p>

<a id="theme_php_types"></a><h2>Item types<a href="#theme_php_types" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" alt="" /></a></h2>
<p>Basically, there can be three types of content in theme.php (from a PHP-coder's point of view). Don't worry though - you don't have to be a coder to be capable to change your theme</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Definitions of constants</strong><br />
  Think of constants as general switches that can be set once while the script is run
  <div class="cpg_example">
  <span class="code">define('THEME_HAS_RATING_GRAPHICS',1);</span></div>
  The constant definition always uses the PHP command <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.define.php" rel="external" class="phpnet"><span class="code">define(...)</span></a> and is thus easy to spot. As a coding convention, the name of constants used in Coppermine are always written in all-uppercase.</li>
  <li><strong>Definition of variables</strong><br />
  Variables can be manipulated (i.e. changed) during runtime. The vast majority of items that can reside in theme.php are variables. Variable names always start with a $-sign.
  <div class="cpg_example">
  <span class="code">$template_sys_menu = &lt;&lt;&lt;EOT<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{BUTTONS}<br />EOT;</span></div></li>
  <li><strong>Definition of functions</strong><br />
  Functions are the most powerfull mechanisms that can reside in theme.php, as they allow great flexibility and are re-usable. They start with the word <span class="code">function</span>, followed by the function name and the parameters in brackets and a curly bracket that actually determines the start of the function. The function definition usually contains several lines of code and ends with a closing curly bracket.
  <div class="cpg_example">
  <span class="code">function endtable()<br />
{<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;echo &lt;&lt;&lt;EOT<br />
&lt;/table&gt;<br />
&lt;!-- End standard table --&gt;<br />
<br />
EOT;<br />
}</span></div></li>
</ul>
<a id="theme_php_types_end"></a>

<a id="theme_sample"></a><h2>The sample theme - a template to copy from<a href="#theme_sample" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" alt="" /></a></h2>
<p>Your Coppermine installation also includes a &quot;sample&quot; theme directory. The &quot;sample&quot; theme includes each of these files but does not show up in the user selectable list of themes in your Coppermine display. Sample's theme.php also holds a copy of every themeable function and template for your reference. If you opt to use the &quot;sample&quot; theme to begin creating your own theme, you should follow the theme.php instructions in the &quot;<a href="theme_upgrade.htm">theme upgrade documentation</a>&quot; and begin with a blank theme.php.</p>
<p class="cpg_message_error">To clarify: you <strong>mustn't</strong> edit the sample theme (as it will not be displayed), but copy the sections you want to see changed from it into your custom theme. Do <strong>not</strong> copy the whole content from themes/sample/theme.php into your custom theme, as this will only clutter your custom theme and will make upgrading very hard in the future. Instead, only copy the sections you want to modify from <span class="code">themes/sample/theme.php</span> into <span class="code">themes/yourtheme/theme.php</span>.</p>
<p>This being said: you mustn't start your custom theme by copying the sample theme - start with a vanilla (i.e. empty!) theme.php instead. Only use themes/sample/theme.php to copy individual sections that you want to modify into your custom theme and then modify it.</p>
<p>Newbies often have issues to understand what a "section" is that they need to copy from the sample theme - if you don't know much about PHP, it's sometimes hard to understand where a function definition starts and where it ends. That's why we have &quot;wrapped&quot; the individual sections that contain more than one line into comment blocks that try to catch your attention: a section starts with the block</p>
<pre>/******************************************************************************
** Section &lt;&lt;&lt;section_name&gt;&gt;&gt; - START
******************************************************************************/</pre>
and ends with
<pre>/******************************************************************************
** Section &lt;&lt;&lt;section_name&gt;&gt;&gt; - END
******************************************************************************/</pre>
<p>where the name of the section (<span class="code">section_name</span> in above example) is identical both in the start-block as well as the end-block.</p>
<p>The place where you insert the section you copied from the sample theme in your custom theme doesn't matter as long as you take care not to paste it within another section, but before or after a section that exists in your custom theme. As a rule of thumb, you can savely paste a section into a new line before <span class="code">?&gt;</span> in your custom theme (<span class="code">themes/yourtheme/theme.php</span>)</p>
<a id="theme_sample_end"></a>

<a id="theme_php_method"></a><h2>Method<a href="#theme_php_method" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" alt="" /></a></h2>
<p>The method behind all theme.php editing is really quite easy - just follow these simple steps:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Determine what section needs to be edited</strong><br />
        There are many different ways how to find that out:
        <ul>
            <li>You found a corresponding posting on the Coppermine support board</li>
            <li>You figured out by looking at the table &quot;<a href="theme_php_list">List of items in theme.php</a>&quot;</li>
            <li>Another part of this documentation says so</li>
            <li>A friend told you so</li>
            <li>...</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Find out if that section already exists in your custom theme:</strong><br />
        (Your favorite <a href="dev_tools.htm#dev_tools_editor">plain-text editor</a> should have a search function. Notepad.exe has got one as well)
        <ul>
            <li>If yes, edit themes/yourtheme/theme.php. No copying from the sample theme needed</li>
            <li>If no, open themes/sample/theme.php with a <a href="dev_tools.htm#dev_tools_editor">plain-text editor</a>, find the section that needs editing, highlight and copy it, then paste it into a new line before <span class="code">?&gt;</span> of <span class="code">themes/yourtheme/theme.php</span>. Then edit the stuff you pasted in as you see fit.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<a id="theme_php_scope"></a><h2>Scope<a href="#theme_php_scope" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" alt="" /></a></h2>
<p>So, what can actually be accomplished by editing theme.php? Well, the sky is the limit: only your imagination can be limited, but the scope of possible edits in theme.php is endless. However, users usually ask for the same five or six features or changes all the time. That's why we have created a page with <a href="theme_examples.htm#theme_examples">theme examples</a> where the most common edits to theme.php are being explained - make sure to have read those examples thoroughly before starting another request on the coppermine support board where you might just be told that you should read the docs...</p>
<p class="cpg_message_success">We're really trying to focus your attention to this block: please read the <a href="theme_examples.htm#theme_examples">theme examples</a> page after having read this page.</p>

The custom icons (as well as the default icons) need to be square in shape.<br />If you decide to use your own set of menu icons for your custom theme, it's advisable to copy the folder <span class="code">images/icons/</span> into <span class="code">themes/yourtheme/images/</span> to have a set of defaults and then start modifying your custom menu items one by one.</td>

<p>Understanding the process to edit theme.php is really important if you want to create a custom theme, so it's mandatory to be familar with what has been explained on this page:</p>
<p class="cpg_message_success">To edit a particular functionality of a theme, take a look at <span class="code">themes/yourtheme/theme.php</span> and search for the section that you want to see changed. If that section exists, edit it as you see fit. If that section does not exist in your custom theme, copy the corresponding section (and only that section) from <span class="code">themes/sample/theme.php</span> into a new line before <span class="code">?&gt;</span> of the file <span class="code">themes/yourtheme/theme.php</span>. Then start editing the code you just pasted in.</p>
