<p>There are certain <strong>minimum requirements</strong> that need to be met in order to be able to install Coppermine:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
	  <a id="what_minimum_webserver"></a><h3>A web server<a href="#what_minimum_webserver" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h3>
	  <img class="imgr" src="../images/apache.gif" alt="" title="Apache" width="180" height="50">
	  Coppermine can run on any webserver - there are reports about successful installs on <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/" rel="external" class="external">Apache</a>,<a href="https://www.nginx.com" rel="external" class="external">NGINX</a>, <a href="https://www.iis.net/" rel="external" class="external">Microsoft Internet Information Server</a> (IIS), <a href="http://www.roxen.com/products/webserver/" rel="external" class="external">Roxen WebServer</a>, <a href="http://www.aprelium.com/" rel="external" class="external">Abyss</a>, <a href="http://www.janaserver.de/" rel="external" class="external">JanaServer</a>. The Coppermine Dev team recommends Apache.
	</li>
	<li>
	  <a id="what_minimum_php"></a><h3>PHP support<a href="#what_minimum_php" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h3>
	  <img class="imgr" src="../images/php-med-trans.png" alt="" title="PHP" width="95" height="51">
	  The webserver must come with support for PHP (version 5.2.1 or 
better; PHP 7 is supported), either compiled with the support for the GD
 library or permission to use the exec() function for the ImageMagick 
"convert" utility in order to make thumbnails and reduced size images. 
Mysql(i) support needs to be compiled into PHP as well.
  </li>
  <li>
	  <a id="what_minimum_mysql"></a><h3>A MySQL database<a href="#what_minimum_mysql" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h3>
	  <img class="imgr" src="../images/mysql.png" alt="" title="mySQL" width="125" height="64">
	  You will need MySQL version 3.23.23 or better. MySQL 4.1 is 
recommended, MySQL 5 is supported. The MySQL user needs the following 
permissions on the database: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, 
DROP, INDEX, ALTER . Most users have these permissions when webhosted. 
If you don't have them, you will not be able to use this or any other 
pre-made scripts at all. If you are uncertain about your permissions, 
please check with your webhost. Most hosting services can probably tell 
you whether Coppermine can or cannot be run on their servers.<br>
	  A database needs to be set up that Coppermine can use - the install script will <strong>not</strong>
 create a database for you, but it will automatically create the tables 
and data structure in your database during install. In most webhosted 
environments, you will already have at least one database set up for you
 by your webhost. If not, you will need to create one. If you do need to
 create a database, check with your webhost on the proper procedures for
 doing so. Write down your database name, userID and password. You will 
require all three to successfully install Coppermine.
  </li>
  <li>
	  <a id="what_minimum_image_library"></a><h3>An image library<a href="#what_minimum_image_library" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h3>
	  <img class="imgr" src="../images/imagemagick.png" alt="" title="ImageMagick" width="130" height="54">
	  <img class="imgl" src="../images/gd.png" alt="" title="GD" width="148" height="93">
	  Coppermine relies on the presence of an image library to create 
resized copies of the images that you upload. Currently, Coppermine can 
use either GD version 2.x (PHP has to be compiled to support it) or 
ImageMagick.<br>
	  (see <a href="install_faq.htm#whatIsImageMagick">What's ImageMagick</a> and <a href="install_faq.htm#WhatIsGD">What is GD</a>)
  </li>
</ul>
<br class="clrb">
<p class="cpg_message_success">It's always a good idea to contact your 
webhosting service first and ask them if they are aware of any known 
issues when installing Coppermine.</p>

<a id="what_minimum_self-hosting"></a><h2>Self-Hosting &amp; Webserver Setup<a href="#what_minimum_self-hosting" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h2>
<p class="cpg_message_info">Although Coppermine can be run on <em>any</em>
 webserver that has the minimum requirements mentioned above, the 
Coppermine Dev team can not support you on setting up your webserver in 
the first place. As suggested, those are requirements, i.e. they have to
 be met before actually considering to run Coppermine. Please note that 
the Coppermine group does <strong>not</strong> recommend self-hosting unless you're an experienced webserver administrator and know your way around.</p>
<p>In fact, some of the Coppermine developers are webserver admins by 
profession, so we can judge this pretty good. We are convinced that 
running a webserver that is publicly accessible on the internet is a 
24/7 task that should only performed by pros who have the needed skills,
 manpower and budget to do so. It is OK to run a locally available 
webserver as a testbed, but we can not recommend self-hosting, 
especially with unsecured setups like webservers on desktop operating 
systems.</p>
<p>When asking for support on the Coppermine support board on issues 
related to webserver setup, you will usually get the stereotype answer 
that webserver setup is beyond the scope of the Coppermine support 
board; we can not teach you webserver setup and administration because 
of the complexity. There is no such thing as the one server setup that 
will work for anybody.</p>

<a id="personal"></a><h2>Personal requirements<a href="#personal" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h2>
<p>Coppermine is aimed at webmasters who have at least basic HTML 
know-how and some experience in setting up pre-made scripts. The 
Coppermine dev team is aware that there are Coppermine users who set up 
their gallery using <a href="auto-installers.htm">auto-installers</a> 
who have little or no experience in setting up similar scripts, which is
 fine as well. We just ask you to read the documentation thoroughly 
before asking questions on the Coppermine support board, as this should 
answer most newbie questions. You can use Coppermine just fine using the
 <a href="theme.htm#theme_builtin">pre-made themes that come with the coppermine package</a>. However, if you want to modify existing themes or <a href="theme_create.htm#theme_create">come up with a theme of your own</a> (that matches the look of the rest of your site), you should have basic to intermediate <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> skills. You don't necessarily need PHP coding skills to run or maintain a Coppermine-driven gallery.</p>
